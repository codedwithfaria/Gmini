This folder contains a minimal Vite + React demo that integrates Monaco Editor inside a Sandpack layout.

Quick start

1. From the `web` folder install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes

- This scaffold assumes you will run the bundler locally if you plan to consume local packages inside Sandpack.
- If you need a production build, run `npm run build` and `npm run preview` to preview the build.
